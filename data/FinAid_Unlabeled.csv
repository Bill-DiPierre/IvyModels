My teacher has put in a grad replacement for me hlw long dpes this take to reflect in my final grades.
I am a behavioral and social science major at nccu  and due to them not having enough housing i am looking to transfer. I want to know if uncc has housing options still available and if i should still apply for the fall or wait a semester?
I do i know my faxed document  was received?
if awarded scholarships will they help out with tuition

Will I receive more money if I change my living status to off campus
 Thanks for your response. I greatly appreciate your help. However  I have a quick follow up question regarding my specific financial situation  given that the amount I would receive is substantially more than the 852.00 you mentioned. I hope you can help.  The stipend money for the grad assistantship Im applying for is set for 8 000.00 total for the year. Im set to receive a loan of 20 500.00 per year (10 250.00 per semester) if I decide not to accept the assistantship.   My question is  if I were to accept the position  will the assistantship stipend money simply fill in or replace whatever is deduced from my financial award as in a dollar per dollar situation? I just want to verify that I will still be given the same amount of money with the assistantship position and not any less than what was offered through my loan award.     Thanks and I hope to hear back from you soon!

I am going to be a first-year grad student in the 2017-2018 school year. I have been offered a federal unsubsidized loan based on fulll-time status. I will only be a part-time student  and I only need the loan to cover tuition (not room  board  etc.). Am I able to just dictate the amount I receive
I am a Research Assistant and a masters student
Hello  I was wondering if I barrow a portion of my Staffford Subsidized loan offer; will the rest of the portion I didnt use be refunded to me? Also  can the other half of the loan offer I didnt use be refunded to me as well or is the overall offer only unique to the Fall and Spring Semester award year? For example  my loan offer is $2 585 per Fall and Spring semester and I only want to barrow 1 292 dollars of it for each semester. Of the $1292 I use $750 for school expenses which leaves with around $540.  Will that $540 we refunded to me for each semester in addition to the other half of the $2 585 offer I didnt use? If not  will the offer still be available for the summer semester or is the loan offer (as mentioned above) only unique for the Fall and Spring Semester award year? Thank You Jessica Redmon
